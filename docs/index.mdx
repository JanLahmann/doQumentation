# Qiskit Tutorials & Learning — Open-Source

**For the best experience, we recommend the official IBM Quantum platform:**
[Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning) · [Tutorials](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials) · [Documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/) · [Source repo](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation)

IBM's Qiskit tutorials and documentation are [open-source](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation), but the web application serving them is not. **doQumentation** is an open-source frontend for this content — browse tutorials, execute code, and run everything offline or self-hosted.

- **[GitHub Pages](https://doqumentation.org)** — Browse tutorials online, execute code via [Binder](https://mybinder.org)
- **[Docker](https://github.com/JanLahmann/doQumentation/pkgs/container/doqumentation)** — Run the full stack locally with `docker compose up` (offline capable)
- **[RasQberry](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two)** — Self-hosted on Raspberry Pi with local Jupyter and JupyterLab

## Getting started

- [CHSH inequality](/tutorials/chsh-inequality) — Run an experiment on a quantum computer
- [Grover's algorithm](/tutorials/grovers-algorithm) — Search with quantum speedup
- [Shor's algorithm](/tutorials/shors-algorithm) — Factor integers with quantum circuits

## How code execution works

Every tutorial has executable Python code blocks. Click **Run** to execute them:

1. **Binder** (default on GitHub Pages) — Free remote Jupyter kernel via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) (first run may take 1-2 min to start)
2. **Local Jupyter** (Docker / RasQberry) — Connects to a local server with Qiskit pre-installed
3. **Custom server** — Point to any Jupyter endpoint in [Settings](/jupyter-settings)
