# doQumentation — Open-source website for IBM Quantum's tutorials and learning content

## We recommend IBM's official platform

For reading and learning, IBM's official [Quantum Platform](https://quantum.ibm.com) and their [Qiskit documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/) is the best place to start:

- **[Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning)** — Structured courses from quantum basics to advanced topics
- **[Tutorials](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials)** — 40+ tutorials on transpilation, error mitigation, and more
- **[Documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/)** — Guides and API reference for Qiskit
- **[Source repo](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation)** — All content is open source (CC BY-SA 4.0)

IBM's platform is always up-to-date, well-designed, and the best place to read the documentation.

## What this project adds

Browse any [tutorial](/tutorials) or course, click **Run** on a code block, and it executes right on the page. Available as:

- **[RasQberry](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two)** — Self-hosted on Raspberry Pi with local Jupyter kernel (full features)
- **[Docker](https://github.com/JanLahmann/doQumentation/pkgs/container/doqumentation)** — Run the full stack locally (offline capable)
- **[GitHub Pages](https://doqumentation.org)** — Static site using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) for remote code execution

## Getting started

- [CHSH inequality](/tutorials/chsh-inequality) — Run an experiment on a quantum computer
- [Grover's algorithm](/tutorials/grovers-algorithm) — Search with quantum speedup
- [Shor's algorithm](/tutorials/shors-algorithm) — Factor integers with quantum circuits

## How code execution works

Every tutorial has executable code blocks. Click **Run** to execute them using one of three backends:

1. **Binder** (default on GitHub Pages) — Free remote Jupyter kernel via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) (first run may take 1–2 min to start)
2. **Local Jupyter (Docker / RasQberry)** — Connects to the local Jupyter server with Qiskit pre-installed
3. **Custom server** — Point to any Jupyter endpoint in [Settings](/jupyter-settings)
