# doQumentation — Open-source website for IBM Quantum's tutorials and learning content

## We recommend IBM's official platform

For reading and learning, IBM's official [Quantum Platform](https://quantum.ibm.com) and their [Qiskit documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/) is the best place to start:

- **[Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning)** — Structured courses from quantum basics to advanced topics
- **[Tutorials](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials)** — 40+ tutorials on transpilation, error mitigation, and more
- **[Documentation](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/)** — Guides and API reference for Qiskit
- **[Source repo](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation)** — All content is open source (CC BY-SA 4.0)

IBM's platform is always up-to-date, well-designed, and the best place to read the documentation.

## What this project adds

IBM's Qiskit tutorials and documentation are open-source, but the web application serving them is not. doQumentation provides an open-source frontend for this content — independently hostable, runnable offline, and deployable on [RasQberry](https://rasqberry.org/).

Browse any tutorial or course, click **Run** on a code block, and it executes right on the page. Available as:

- **[GitHub Pages](https://doqumentation.org)** — Static site using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) for remote code execution
- **[Docker](https://github.com/JanLahmann/doQumentation/pkgs/container/doqumentation)** — Run the full stack locally (offline capable)
- **[RasQberry](https://rasqberry.org/)** — Self-hosted on Raspberry Pi with local Jupyter kernel (full features)

## Getting started

Browse the **[Tutorials](/tutorials)** and **[Courses](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information)** in the sidebar, or try one of these:

- [CHSH inequality](/tutorials/chsh-inequality) — Run a Bell test on a quantum computer
- [Quantum kernel training](/tutorials/quantum-kernel-training) — Machine learning with quantum kernels
- [Grover's algorithm](/tutorials/grovers-algorithm) — Search with quantum speedup
- [Introduction to single systems](/learning/courses/basics-of-quantum-information/single-systems/introduction) — First lesson in the Basics of Quantum Information course

**Running code on Binder:** Click **Run** on any code block. The first execution starts a free Jupyter kernel via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) — this may take 1–2 minutes. Subsequent runs in the same session are instant. Binder sessions are temporary; work is not saved between sessions.

**Using IBM Quantum backends:** Many notebooks connect to IBM Quantum backends. To run them, you need a free [IBM Quantum](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com) account. See the section [Setting up your IBM Quantum account](https://q-docs.org#setting-up-your-ibm-quantum-account) on q-docs.org for setup instructions.

## How code execution works

Every tutorial has executable code blocks. Click **Run** to execute them using one of three backends:

1. **Binder** (default on GitHub Pages) — Free remote Jupyter kernel via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org)
2. **Local Jupyter (Docker / RasQberry)** — Connects to the local Jupyter server with Qiskit pre-installed
3. **Custom server** — Point to any Jupyter endpoint in [Settings](/jupyter-settings)
