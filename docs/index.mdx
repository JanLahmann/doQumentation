# Welcome to doQumentation

Interactive IBM Quantum tutorials — read, run, and explore on RasQberry or in your browser.

## How it works

- **Read** — Browse tutorials with syntax-highlighted code
- **Run** — Click Run on any tutorial to execute code via Jupyter (Binder on this site, or a local server on RasQberry)
- **Explore** — Open full notebooks in JupyterLab for deeper experimentation

## Getting started

Head to the [Tutorials](/tutorials) page to browse all available tutorials, or jump straight to:

- [CHSH inequality](/tutorials/chsh-inequality) — Run an experiment on a quantum computer
- [Grover's algorithm](/tutorials/grovers-algorithm) — Search with quantum speedup
- [Shor's algorithm](/tutorials/shors-algorithm) — Factor integers with quantum circuits

## Jupyter execution

Code blocks can be executed in three ways:

1. **On this site** — Uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) for free remote execution (may take 1–2 min to start)
2. **On RasQberry** — Automatically connects to the local Jupyter server
3. **Custom server** — Configure your own Jupyter endpoint in [Settings](/jupyter-settings)
