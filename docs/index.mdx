# Qiskit Documentation — Interactive Notebooks

Built on [Qiskit/documentation](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation) with interactive execution support.

For reading docs (tutorials, courses, etc), we recommend the official IBM websites — they are more current, better maintained, and have a much better layout and design: [Learning](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/learning) · [Tutorials](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/tutorials) · [Source repo](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation)

Use **doQumentation.org** when you want to **run notebook code directly in your browser** — browse any [Tutorial](/tutorials), click **Run** on a code block, and it executes right on the page. Available as:

- **[RasQberry](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two)** — Self-hosted on Raspberry Pi with local Jupyter kernel (full features)
- **[Docker](https://github.com/JanLahmann/doQumentation/pkgs/container/doqumentation)** — Run the full stack locally with `docker compose up`
- **[GitHub Pages](https://janlahmann.github.io/doQumentation/)** — Static site using [Binder](https://mybinder.org) for remote code execution

## Getting started

- [CHSH inequality](/tutorials/chsh-inequality) — Run an experiment on a quantum computer
- [Grover's algorithm](/tutorials/grovers-algorithm) — Search with quantum speedup
- [Shor's algorithm](/tutorials/shors-algorithm) — Factor integers with quantum circuits

## How code execution works

Every tutorial has executable code blocks. Click **Run** to execute them using one of three backends:

1. **Binder** (default on GitHub Pages) — Free remote Jupyter kernel via [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org) (first run may take 1–2 min to start)
2. **RasQberry** — Connects to the local Jupyter server on your [RasQberry](https://github.com/JanLahmann/RasQberry-Two)
3. **Custom server** — Point to any Jupyter endpoint in [Settings](/jupyter-settings)
