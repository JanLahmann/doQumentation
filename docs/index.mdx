# Welcome to doQumentation

Interactive IBM Quantum tutorials and courses, with live code execution via Jupyter.

## Features

- **▶️ Run** - Execute Python code directly in the browser via Jupyter
- **🔬 Lab** - Open full notebooks in JupyterLab (on RasQberry)

## Getting Started

New to quantum computing? Start with [Hello World](/tutorials/hello-world).

## Jupyter Execution

Python code blocks include a **Run** button that connects to a Jupyter kernel:

1. **On GitHub Pages / doqumentation.org** - Uses [Binder](https://mybinder.org) for remote execution (first launch may take 1–2 minutes)
2. **On RasQberry** - Automatically connects to the local Jupyter server
3. **Custom Server** - Configure your own Jupyter server in [Settings](/jupyter-settings)
