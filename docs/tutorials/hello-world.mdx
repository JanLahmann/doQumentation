# Hello World

This tutorial demonstrates how to create and run a simple quantum circuit using Qiskit.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Qiskit installed:

```bash noexec
pip install qiskit qiskit-aer
```

## Create a Quantum Circuit

Let's create a simple Bell state circuit:

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit

# Create a circuit with 2 qubits and 2 classical bits
qc = QuantumCircuit(2, 2)

# Apply Hadamard gate to qubit 0
qc.h(0)

# Apply CNOT gate with qubit 0 as control and qubit 1 as target
qc.cx(0, 1)

# Measure both qubits
qc.measure([0, 1], [0, 1])

# Display the circuit
print(qc)
```

## Run on a Simulator

Now let's run the circuit on a local simulator:

```python
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator

# Create a simulator backend
simulator = AerSimulator()

# Run the circuit
job = simulator.run(qc, shots=1000)
result = job.result()

# Get the counts
counts = result.get_counts(qc)
print(f"Measurement results: {counts}")
```

## Visualize the Results

```python
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

# Plot the histogram of results
plot_histogram(counts)
```

- Explore [Grover's algorithm](/tutorials/grovers-algorithm)
- Try running on real quantum hardware via IBM Quantum

:::note
This tutorial uses a local simulator. To run on real quantum hardware,
you'll need an IBM Quantum account.
