<details>
<summary><b>Package versions</b></summary>

The code on this page was developed using the following requirements.
We recommend using these versions or newer.

```
qiskit[all]~=1.4.0
qiskit-ibm-runtime~=0.36.1
qiskit-ibm-catalog~=0.4
```
</details>
This section explores how to use `qiskit-ibm-catalog` to list programs available in Qiskit Serverless, pass inputs into these programs, run them remotely, check their status, and retrieve results and logs.

Be sure you have authenticated to Qiskit Serverless using your [API key](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) (see [Deploy to IBM Quantum Platform](./serverless-first-program#deploy-to-ibm-quantum-platform) for instructions).
## List programs available

You can use `QiskitServerless.list()` to fetch a list of the available programs to run with Qiskit Serverless. This includes the previously uploaded [`transpile_remote_serverless`](./serverless-first-program).

```python
from qiskit_ibm_catalog import QiskitServerless

serverless = QiskitServerless()
next(
    program
    for program in serverless.list()
    if program.title == "transpile_remote_serverless"
)
```

```text
QiskitFunction(transpile_remote_serverless)
```

## Run an uploaded program and pass inputs

First, set up your inputs. Your program has three inputs: `circuits`, `backend`, and `optimization_level`. You can use `random_circuit` to create 30 random circuits:

```python
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

qc_random = [(random_circuit(4, 4, measure=True, seed=i)) for i in range(10)]
qc_random[0].draw(output="mpl", idle_wires=False)
```

Next, use `QiskitRuntimeService` and `least_busy` to select a `backend`:

```python
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
backend = service.least_busy(operational=True, simulator=False)
print(backend.name)
```

Set your optimization level:

```python
optimization_level = 3
```

Select your program with `serverless.load('PROGRAM_NAME')`:

```python
transpile_remote_serverless = serverless.load("transpile_remote_serverless")
```

Next, pass your inputs and run it in a pythonic fashion as follows:

```python
job = transpile_remote_serverless.run(
    circuits=qc_random,
    backend=backend.name,
    optimization_level=optimization_level,
)
```

```python
job.job_id
```

```text
'118256c5-bbb0-4ea8-9e9f-51aac2220aef'
```

## Check job status

With your Qiskit Serverless `job_id`, you can check the status of running jobs. This includes the following statuses:

- **`QUEUED`**: The remote program is in the Qiskit Serverless queue. The queue priority is currently based on how much you've used Qiskit Serverless
- **`INITIALIZING`**: The remote program is starting; this includes setting up the remote environment and installing dependencies
- **`RUNNING`**: The program is running. At this stage, if you have `print()` outputs in your program, you can retrieve logs using `job.logs()`
- **`DONE`**: The program is complete, and you can retrieve data stored in `save_result()` with `job.results()`

You can also set more detailed job statuses in [Manage Qiskit Serverless compute and data resources](/guides/serverless-manage-resources).

```python
job.status()
```

```text
'QUEUED'
```

```python
# This cell is hidden from users, it checks the job status
assert _ in ["QUEUED", "INITIALIZING", "RUNNING", "DONE"]  # noqa: F821
```

<Admonition type="tip">
Currently, the IBM Quantum workloads table only reflects Qiskit Runtime workloads. Use `job.status()` to see your Qiskit Serverless workload's current status.

You've successfully run your first Qiskit Serverless program!
## Retrieve logs and results

As mentioned before, once a program is `RUNNING`, you can use `job.logs()` to fetch logs created from `print()` outputs:

```python
logs = job.logs()
print(logs)
```

```text
No logs yet.
```

At any time, you can also cancel a job:

```python
job.stop()
```

```text
'Job has been stopped.'
```

Once a program is `DONE`, you can use `job.results()` to fetch the result stored in `save_result()`:

```python
# We can't get results from a cancelled job, so we'll fetch a completed one instead
completed_job = next(
    job for job in serverless.jobs() if job.status() == "DONE"
)
completed_job.result()
```

## List jobs previously run with Qiskit Serverless

You can use `jobs()` to list all jobs submitted to Qiskit Serverless:

```python
old_jobs = serverless.jobs()
old_jobs
```

```text
[<Job | 118256c5-bbb0-4ea8-9e9f-51aac2220aef>,
 <Job | e9a36469-7d6b-4f00-bf91-78709ebdbbff>,
