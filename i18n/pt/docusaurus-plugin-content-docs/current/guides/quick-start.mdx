Build your first quantum circuit in under two minutes, on your local environment - no sign-in or API key necessary.

<Admonition type="note" title="New to Python and virtual environments?">

* Download Python and use a virtual environment with Qiskit (recommended).

- To install Python, first check the "Programming Language" section on the [Qiskit PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/qiskit/) to determine which Python versions are supported by the most recent release. For download instructions, see the [Python Beginners Guide.](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)

<Admonition type="note">
These instructions use the standard Python distribution from [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/). However, you can use other Python distributions, such as [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/) or [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/), along with other dependency management workflows like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).

    </summary>
    - Use [Python virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) to separate Qiskit from other applications.
    A Python virtual environment is an isolated space to work with Python for a specific purpose — so you can install whatever packages you wish, and set up libraries, dependencies, and so on, without affecting the "base" Python environment on your machine.

    One important advantage of a virtual environment is that if your Python environment becomes corrupted, you can easily delete it and start over!

    Choose a preferred location in which to store information about your virtual environments. Typically they're stored in a directory named `.venv` within each project directory.

    To set up a virtual environment, navigate to your project directory and create a minimal environment with only Python installed in it.

          <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv .venv
            ```
          </TabItem>

          <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
            ```shell
            python3 -m venv .venv

            ```

         </OperatingSystemTabs>

    Next, activate your new environment.

             source .venv/bin/activate

           <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
             ```shell
             source .venv/bin/activate
             ```
           </TabItem>

           <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
              If using PowerShell:

             ```
             If using Git Bash:

             .venv\Scripts\activate
             ```

## 1. Install Qiskit

Install the following with your preferred package manager (such as `pip`):

- [`qiskit`](/guides/install-qiskit)
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/quick_start.html)
- [`qiskit[visualization]`](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/visualization)
## 2. Build your circuit

Open a Python environment, then run this code to build a Bell state (two entangled qubits).

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit
from qiskit.primitives import StatevectorSampler

qc = QuantumCircuit(2)
qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.measure_all()

sampler = StatevectorSampler()
result = sampler.run([qc], shots=1024).result()
print(result[0].data.meas.get_counts())
```

```text
{'11': 534, '00': 490}
```

The expected output is a near-even split between '00' and '11'.
## 3. Visualize your results

To get a histogram of your results, add the following code to your program.

```python
# Uncomment lines 2 and 8 if you are not using Python in a Jupyter notebook
# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from qiskit.visualization import plot_histogram

counts = result[0].data.meas.get_counts()
plot_histogram(counts)

# plt.show()
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/guides/quick-start/extracted-outputs/dc4ff012-0.svg)

This result is a signature of quantum entanglement.

## 4. See what happens

Try changing the code to see how it affects the results. For example:

- Add a third qubit by changing to `QuantumCircuit(3)`, and add a second CX gate with `qc.cx(1,2)`. The measurements should then change to 000 and 111, which means all three of these qubits have been entangled.

- See your results shift by adding `qc.x(1)` to the end of the circuit.
