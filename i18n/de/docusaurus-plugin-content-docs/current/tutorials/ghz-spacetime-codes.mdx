## Introduction

[Low-overhead error detection with spacetime codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15725) [[1]](#references) by Simon Martiel and Ali Javadi-Abhari proposes synthesizing low-weight, connectivity-aware spacetime checks for Clifford-dominated circuits, then post-selecting on those checks to catch faults with far less overhead than full error correction and fewer shots than standard error mitigation.

This paper proposes a novel method for error detection in quantum circuits (specifically Clifford circuits) that strikes a balance between full error correction and lighter-weight mitigation techniques. The key idea is to use spacetime codes to generate "checks" across the circuit that are capable of catching errors, with significantly lower qubit and gate overhead than full fault-tolerant error correction. The authors design efficient algorithms to select checks that are low-weight (involving few qubits), compatible with the physical connectivity of the device, and cover large temporal and spatial regions of the circuit. They demonstrate the approach on circuits with up to 50 logical qubits and ~2450 CZ gates, achieving physical-to-logical fidelity gains of up to 236x. Also note that as circuits include more non-Clifford operations, the number of valid checks shrinks exponentially, indicating the method works best for Clifford-dominated circuits. Overall, in the near term, error detection via spacetime codes may offer a practical, lower-overhead route to improving reliability in quantum hardware.

This error detection technique relies on the notion of coherent Pauli checks and is based on the work [Single-shot error mitigation by coherent Pauli checks](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.033193) [[2]](#references) by van den Berg et al.

More recently, the paper [Big cats: entanglement in 120 qubits and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09520) [[3]](#references) by Javadi-Abhari et al., reports the creation of a 120-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, the largest multipartite entangled state achieved to date on a superconducting-qubit platform. Using a hardware-aware compiler, low-overhead error detection, and a "temporary uncomputation" technique to reduce noise, the researchers achieved a fidelity of 0.56 ± 0.03 with about 28% post-selection efficiency. The work demonstrates genuine entanglement across all 120 qubits, validating multiple fidelity-certification methods, and marks a major benchmark for scalable quantum hardware.

This tutorial builds on these ideas, guiding you through implementing the error detection algorithm first on a small-scale random Clifford circuit and then through the task of GHZ state preparation, to help you experiment with error detection on your own quantum circuits.

## First example
To demonstrate this method, we start by constructing a simple Clifford circuit. Our goal is to be able to detect when certain types of error occur in this circuit, so that we can discard erroneous measurement results. In error detection terminology, this is also known as our payload circuit.

```python
circ = random_clifford(num_qubits=2, seed=11).to_circuit()
circ.draw("mpl")
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/f8384a7d-0.avif)

Our goal is to insert a coherent Pauli check into this payload circuit. But before we do that, we separate this circuit into layers. This will be useful later when inserting Pauli gates in between.

```python
# Separate circuit into layers
dag = circuit_to_dag(circ)
circ_layers = []
for layer in dag.layers():
    layer_as_circuit = dag_to_circuit(layer["graph"])
    circ_layers.append(layer_as_circuit)

# Create subplots
fig, (ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4, ax5) = plt.subplots(1, 5, figsize=(10, 4))

# Draw circuits on respective axes
circ_layers[0].draw(output="mpl", ax=ax1)
circ_layers[1].draw(output="mpl", ax=ax2)
circ_layers[2].draw(output="mpl", ax=ax3)
circ_layers[3].draw(output="mpl", ax=ax4)
circ_layers[4].draw(output="mpl", ax=ax5)

# Adjust layout to prevent overlap
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/04bb6ea7-0.avif)

Now we are ready to add coherent Pauli checks into the payload circuit. To do this, we need to construct a "valid check" and insert it into the circuit. A "check" in this case is an operator that is capable of signaling whether an error occurred in the circuit by making a measurement on an ancilla qubit. It is considered a valid check when the additional operators inserted into the quantum circuit don't logically change the original circuit.

This check is capable of detecting types of errors that anticommute with it, and the check will trigger a measurement of $\ket{1}$ state in the ancilla qubit instead of $\ket{0}$ through phase kickback. Therefore, we will be able to discard measurements where an error was signaled.

In general, coherent Pauli checks are controlled-Pauli operators inserted into "wires" - spacetime locations between gates. The ancilla qubit responsible for signaling the error is the control qubit.

Below we construct a valid check for the Clifford circuit we created above. We can demonstrate that this check doesn't change the circuit operation by showing that when these Pauli checks are propagated to the front of the circuit, they cancel each other out. This is easily shown because a Pauli operator through a Clifford gate is another Pauli operator.

In general, one can use a decoding heuristic as outlined in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15725) to identify valid checks. For the purposes of our initial example, we can also construct valid checks by using analytical Pauli and Clifford gate multiplication conditions.

```python
# Define a valid check
pauli_1 = Pauli("ZI")
pauli_2 = Pauli("XZ")
```

```python
circ_1 = circ_layers[0].compose(circ_layers[1])
circ_1.draw("mpl")
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/e1c1e16d-0.avif)

```python
pauli_1_ev = pauli_1.evolve(circ_1, frame="h")
pauli_1_ev
```

```text
Pauli('-ZI')
```

```python
circ_2 = circ.copy()
circ_2.draw("mpl")
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/246a42b8-0.avif)

```python
pauli_2_ev = pauli_2.evolve(circ_2, frame="h")
pauli_2_ev
```

```text
Pauli('-ZI')
```

```python
pauli_1_ev.dot(pauli_2_ev)
```

```text
Pauli('II')
```

As we can see, we have a valid check, since the inserted Pauli operators simply have the same effect as an identity operator on the circuit. We can now insert these checks into the circuit with an ancilla qubit. This ancilla qubit, or the check qubit, starts the in the $\ket{+}$ state. It includes the controlled versions of the Pauli operations outlined above and is finally measured in the $X$ basis. This check qubit is now capable of capturing errors in the payload circuit without logically altering it. This is because certain types of noise in the payload circuit will modify the state of the check qubit, and it will be measured "1" instead of "0" in case such an error occurs.

```python
# New circuit with 3 qubits (2 payload + 1 ancilla for check)
circ_meas = QuantumCircuit(3)
circ_meas.h(0)
circ_meas.compose(circ_layers[0], [1, 2], inplace=True)
circ_meas.compose(circ_layers[1], [1, 2], inplace=True)
circ_meas.cz(0, 2)
circ_meas.compose(circ_layers[2], [1, 2], inplace=True)
circ_meas.compose(circ_layers[3], [1, 2], inplace=True)
circ_meas.compose(circ_layers[4], [1, 2], inplace=True)
circ_meas.cz(0, 1)
circ_meas.cx(0, 2)
circ_meas.h(0)

# Add measurement to payload qubits
c0 = ClassicalRegister(2, name="c0")
circ_meas.add_register(c0)
circ_meas.measure(1, c0[0])
circ_meas.measure(2, c0[1])

# Add measurement to check qubit
c1 = ClassicalRegister(1, name="c1")
circ_meas.add_register(c1)
circ_meas.measure(0, c1[0])

# Visualize the final circuit with the inserted checks
circ_meas.draw("mpl")
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/52add690-0.avif)

If the check qubit is measured in "0", we keep that measurement. If it's measured in "1", then this means that that an error occurred in the payload circuit, and we discard that measurement.

```python
# Noiseless simulation using stabilizer method
sim_stab = AerSimulator(method="stabilizer")
res = sim_stab.run(circ_meas, shots=1000).result()
counts_noiseless = res.get_counts()
print(f"Stabilizer simulation result: {counts_noiseless}")
```

```text
Stabilizer simulation result: {'0 11': 523, '0 01': 477}
```

```python
# Plot the noiseless results
# Note that the first bit in the key corresponds to the check qubit
plot_histogram(counts_noiseless)
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/4741910b-0.avif)

Note that with an ideal simulator, the check qubit doesn't detect any errors. We now introduce a noise model to the simulation and see how the check qubit captures errors.

```python
# Qiskit Aer noise model
noise = NoiseModel()
p2 = 0.003  # two-qubit depolarizing per CZ
p1 = 0.001  # one-qubit depolarizing per 1q Clifford
pr = 0.01  # readout bit-flip probability

# 1q depolarizing on common 1q gates
e1 = depolarizing_error(p1, 1)
for g1 in ["id", "rz", "sx", "x", "h", "s"]:
    noise.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(e1, g1)

# 2q depolarizing on CZ
e2 = depolarizing_error(p2, 2)
noise.add_all_qubit_quantum_error(e2, "cz")

# Readout error on measure
ro = ReadoutError([[1 - pr, pr], [pr, 1 - pr]])
noise.add_all_qubit_readout_error(ro)

# Qiskit Aer simulation with noise model
aer = AerSimulator(method="automatic", seed_simulator=43210)
job = aer.run(circ_meas, shots=1000, noise_model=noise)
result = job.result()
counts_noisy = result.get_counts()
print(f"Noise model simulation result: {counts_noisy}")
```

```text
Noise model simulation result: {'1 01': 5, '0 11': 478, '1 11': 6, '1 00': 2, '1 10': 1, '0 01': 500, '0 00': 5, '0 10': 3}
```

```python
plot_histogram(counts_noisy)
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/51a8f3d9-0.avif)

As we can see, some measurements captured the error by flagging the check qubit as "1", which are visible in the last four columns. These shots are discarded.
Note: The ancilla qubit can also introduce new errors to the circuit. To reduce the effect of this, we can insert nested checks with additional ancilla qubits to the quantum circuit.
## Real-world example: Prepare a GHZ state on real hardware
### Step 1: Map classical inputs to a quantum problem
Now we demonstrate a significant task for quantum computing algorithms, which is preparing a GHZ state. We will demonstrate how to do this on a real backend using error detection.

```python
# Set optional seed for reproducibility
SEED = 1

if SEED:
    np.random.seed(SEED)
```

The error detection algorithm for GHZ state preparation respects the hardware topology. We begin by selecting the desired hardware.

```python
# This is used to run on real hardware
service = QiskitRuntimeService()

# Choose a backend to build GHZ on
backend_name = service.least_busy(
    operational=True, simulator=False, min_num_qubits=133
)

backend = service.backend(backend_name)
coupling_map = backend.target.build_coupling_map()
```

A GHZ state on $n$ qubits is defined as
$$\lvert \mathrm{GHZ}_n\rangle \;=\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(\lvert 0\rangle^{\otimes n} \,+\, \lvert 1\rangle^{\otimes n}\Big).$$

A very naive approach to prepare the GHZ state would be to choose a root qubit with an initial Hadamard gate, which puts the qubit to an equal superposition state, and then to entangle this qubit with every other qubit. This is not a good approach, since it requires long-range and deep CNOT interactions. In this tutorial, we will use multiple techniques alongside error detection to reliably prepare the GHZ state on real hardware.
### Step 2: Optimize problem for quantum hardware execution
#### Map the GHZ state to hardware
First, we search for a root to map the GHZ circuit on hardware. We remove edges/nodes whose CZ errors, measurement errors, and the T2 values are worse than the thresholds below. These will not be included in the GHZ circuit.

```python
def bad_cz(target, threshold=0.01):
    """Return list of edges whose CZ error is worse than threshold."""
    undirected_edges = []
    for edge in backend.target.build_coupling_map().get_edges():
        if (edge[1], edge[0]) not in undirected_edges:
            undirected_edges.append(edge)
    edges = undirected_edges
    cz_errors = {}
    for edge in edges:
        cz_errors[edge] = target["cz"][edge].error
    worst_edges = sorted(cz_errors.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return [list(edge) for edge, error in worst_edges if error > threshold]

def bad_readout(target, threshold=0.01):
    """Return list of nodes whose measurement error is worse than threshold."""
    meas_errors = {}
    for node in range(backend.num_qubits):
        meas_errors[node] = target["measure"][(node,)].error
    worst_nodes = sorted(
        meas_errors.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True
    )
    return [node for node, error in worst_nodes if error > threshold]

def bad_coherence(target, threshold=60):
    """Return list of nodes whose T2 value is lower than threshold."""
    t2s = {}
    for node in range(backend.num_qubits):
        t2 = target.qubit_properties[node].t2
        t2s[node] = t2 * 1e6 if t2 else 0
    worst_nodes = sorted(t2s.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    return [node for node, val in worst_nodes if val < threshold]

THRESH_CZ = 0.025  # exclude from BFS those edges whose CZ error is worse than this threshold
THRESH_MEAS = 0.15  # exclude from BFS those nodes whose measurement error is worse than this threshold
THRESH_T2 = 10  # exclude from BFS those nodes whose T2 value is lower than this threshold

bad_edges = bad_cz(backend.target, threshold=THRESH_CZ)
bad_nodes_readout = bad_readout(backend.target, threshold=THRESH_MEAS)
dead_qubits = bad_readout(backend.target, threshold=0.4)
bad_nodes_coherence = bad_coherence(backend.target, threshold=THRESH_T2)
bad_nodes = list(set(bad_nodes_readout) | set(bad_nodes_coherence))
print(f"{len(bad_edges)} bad edges: \n{bad_edges}")
print(f"{len(bad_nodes)} bad nodes: \n{bad_nodes}")
```

```text
17 bad edges: 
[[30, 31], [112, 113], [113, 114], [113, 119], [120, 121], [130, 131], [145, 146], [146, 147], [111, 112], [55, 59], [64, 65], [131, 138], [131, 132], [119, 133], [129, 130], [47, 57], [29, 38]]
5 bad nodes: 
[1, 113, 131, 146, 120]
```

Using the function below, we construct the GHZ circuit on the chosen hardware starting from the root and using breadth-first search (BFS).

```python
def parallel_ghz(root, num_qubits, backend, bad_edges, skip):
    """

    It grows the entanglement tree outward layer-by-layer.

We now repeatedly search for the best root, where the GHZ circuit will originate from.

```python
ROOT = None  # root for BFS search
GHZ_SIZE = 100  # number of (data) qubits in the GHZ state
SKIP = []  # nodes to intentionally skip so that we have a better chance for finding checks

# Search for the best root (yielding the shallowest GHZ)
if ROOT is None:
    best_root = -1
    base_depth = 100
    for root in range(backend.num_qubits):
        qc, ghz_qubits, _ = parallel_ghz(
            root, GHZ_SIZE, backend, bad_edges, SKIP
        )
        if len(ghz_qubits) != GHZ_SIZE:
            continue
        depth = qc.depth(lambda x: x.operation.num_qubits == 2)
        if depth < base_depth:
            best_root = root
            base_depth = depth
    ROOT = best_root
```

We now construct the GHZ circuit starting from a specific node - as in, the best root - searching for the shortest depth using breadth-first search.

```python
# Build a GHZ starting at the best root
qc, ghz_qubits, _ = parallel_ghz(
    ROOT, GHZ_SIZE, backend, bad_edges, SKIP + bad_nodes
)
base_depth = qc.depth(lambda x: x.operation.num_qubits == 2)
base_count = qc.size(lambda x: x.operation.num_qubits == 2)
print(f"base depth: {base_depth}, base count: {base_count}")
print(f"ROOT: {ROOT}")
if len(ghz_qubits) != GHZ_SIZE:
    raise Exception("No GHZ found. Relax error thresholds.")
```

```text
base depth: 17, base count: 99
ROOT: 50
```

We need one final consideration before inserting valid checks. This is related to the concept of "coverage", which is a measure of how many of the wires in a quantum circuit a check can cover. With a higher coverage, we can detect errors on a wider part of the circuit. With this measure, we can select among the valid checks with the highest circuit coverage. In other words, we will be using the `weighted_coverage` function to score different checks for the GHZ circuit.

```python

We can now insert checks to the GHZ circuit. Finding valid checks is very convenient for the GHZ state, since any two-qubit Pauli $Z$ operator $Z_i Z_j$ acting on any two qubits $i,j$ of the GHZ circuit is a support and therefore a valid check.

Also note that the checks in this case are controlled-$Z$ operators neighboring Hadamard gates from the left and right on the ancilla qubit. This is equivalent to a CNOT gate applied to the ancilla qubit. The code below inserts the checks into the circuit.

```python

As expected, the check qubits are measured as all zeros, and we successfully prepared the GHZ state.
### Step 3: Execute using Qiskit primitives
Now we are ready to run the circuit on real hardware and demonstrate how the error detection protocol can capture errors in GHZ state preparation.

```python
BAD_QUBITS = []  # specify any additional bad qubits to avoid (this is specific to the chosen backend)
SHOTS = 10000  # number of shots
```

We define a helper function to add measurements to the GHZ circuit.

```python
def add_measurements(qc, ghz_qubits, checks):
    # --- Measure each set of qubits into different classical registers to facilitate post-processing ---

    # Add measurements to the GHZ qubits
    c1 = ClassicalRegister(len(ghz_qubits), "c1")
    qc.add_register(c1)
    for q, c in zip(ghz_qubits, c1):
        qc.measure(q, c)

    # Add measurements to the check qubits
    c2 = ClassicalRegister(len(checks), "c2")
    qc.add_register(c2)
    for q, c in zip(checks, c2):
        qc.measure(q, c)

    return qc
```

Before execution, we draw the layout of the GHZ qubits and the check qubits on the selected hardware.

```python
# Plot the layout of GHZ and check qubits on the device
plot_gate_map(
    backend,
    label_qubits=True,
    line_width=20,
    line_color=[
        "black"
        if edge[0] in ghz_qubits + checks and edge[1] in ghz_qubits + checks
        else "lightgrey"
        for edge in backend.coupling_map.graph.edge_list()
    ],
    qubit_color=[
        "blue"
        if i in ghz_qubits
        else "salmon"
        if i in checks
        else "lightgrey"
        for i in range(0, backend.num_qubits)
    ],
)
plt.show()
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/d0faf114-0.avif)

```python
qc.draw("mpl", idle_wires=False, fold=-1)
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/error-detection/extracted-outputs/78c8c2b6-0.avif)

We now add the measurements.

```python
qc = add_measurements(qc, ghz_qubits, checks)
```

The scheduling pipeline below locks in timing, removes barriers, simplifies delays, and injects dynamical decoupling, all while preserving the original operation times.

```python
# The scheduling consists of first inserting delays while barriers are still there
# Then removing the barriers and consolidating the delays, so that the operations do not move in time
# Lastly we replace delays with dynamical decoupling

                dd_sequence=[XGate(), RZGate(-np.pi), XGate(), RZGate(np.pi)],
                spacing=[1 / 4, 1 / 2, 0, 0, 1 / 4],
                target=backend.target,
                qubits=dd_qubits,
            ),
        ]
    )

    return pm
```

We can now use the custom pass manager to transpile the circuit for the selected backend.

```python
# Transpile the circuits for the backend
pm = build_passmanager(backend, ghz_qubits)

# Instruction set architecture (ISA) level circuit after scheduling and DD insertion
isa_circuit = pm.run(qc)

# Draw after scheduling and DD insertion
# timeline_drawer(isa_circuit, show_idle=False, time_range=(0, 1000), target=backend.target)
```

```python
isa_circuit.draw("mpl", fold=-1, idle_wires=False)
```

We then submit the job using the Qiskit Runtime Sampler primitive.

```python
# Select the sampler options
sampler = Sampler(mode=backend)
sampler.options.default_shots = SHOTS
sampler.options.dynamical_decoupling.enable = False
sampler.options.execution.rep_delay = 0.00025

# Submit the job
print("Submitting sampler job")
ghz_job = sampler.run([isa_circuit])

print(ghz_job.job_id())
```

```

### Step 4: Post-process and return result in desired classical format
We can now retrieve and analyze the results from the Sampler job.

```python
# Retrieve the job results
job_result = ghz_job.result()
```

```python
# Get the counts from GHZ and check qubit measurements
ghz_counts = job_result[0].data.c1.get_counts()
checks_counts = job_result[0].data.c2.get_counts()
```

```python
# Post-process to get unflagged GHZ counts (i.e., check bits are all '0')
joined_counts = job_result[0].join_data().get_counts()
unflagged_counts = {}
for key, count in joined_counts.items():
    check_bits = key[: len(checks)]
    ghz_bits = key[len(checks) :]
    if set(check_bits) == {"0"}:
        unflagged_counts[ghz_bits] = count
```

```python
# Get top 20 outcomes by frequency from the unflagged counts
top_counts = dict(
    sorted(unflagged_counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:20]
)

# Rename keys for better visualization
top_counts_renamed = {}
i = 0
for key, count in top_counts.items():
    if set(key) == {"0"}:
        top_counts_renamed["all 0s"] = count
    elif set(key) == {"1"}:
        top_counts_renamed["all 1s"] = count
    else:
        top_counts_renamed[f"other_{i}"] = count
        i += 1

plot_histogram(top_counts_renamed, figsize=(12, 7))
```

In the histogram above, we plotted 20 bitstring measurements from the GHZ qubits that were not flagged by the check qubits. As expected, all-0 and all-1 bitstrings have the highest counts. Note that some erroneous bitstrings with low error weights were not captured by the error detection. The highest counts are still found in the expected bitstrings.
## Discussion

In this tutorial, we showed how to implement a low-overhead error detection technique using spacetime codes, and demonstrated its real-world application to preparing GHZ states on hardware. Refer to [[3]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09520) to further explore technical details of GHZ state preparation. In addition to error detection, authors utilize readout error mitigation with M3 and TREX and perform temporary uncomputation techniques to prepare high-fidelity GHZ states.
