## Background

This tutorial shows how to use [QESEM](/guides/qedma-qesem), Qedma's Qiskit Function, to simulate the dynamics of a canonical quantum spin model, the 2D tilted-field Ising (TFI) model with non-Clifford angles:

$$
H = J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} Z_i Z_j + g_x \sum_i X_i + g_z \sum_i Z_i ,
$$

where $ \langle i,j \rangle $ denotes nearest neighbors on a lattice. Simulating the time evolution of many-body quantum systems is a computationally hard task for classical computers. Quantum computers, by contrast, are naturally designed to perform this task efficiently. The TFI model, in particular, has become a popular benchmark on quantum hardware due to its rich physical behavior and hardware-friendly implementation.

Instead of simulating continuous-time dynamics, we adopt the closely-related kicked Ising model. The dynamics can be expressed exactly as a periodic quantum circuit, where each evolution step consists of three layers of fractional two-qubit gates $ R_{ZZ} (\alpha_{ZZ}) $, interleaved with layers of single-qubit gates $ R_X (\alpha_X) $ and $ R_Z (\alpha_Z) $.

We will use generic angles that are challenging for both classical simulation and error mitigation. Specifically, we chose $ \alpha_{ZZ} = 1.0 $, $ \alpha_X = 0.53 $, and $ \alpha_Z = 0.1 $, placing the model far from any integrable point.

In this tutorial we will do the following:
* Estimate the expected QPU runtime for full error mitigation using QESEM's analytical and empirical time estimation features.
* Construct and simulate the 2D tilted-field Ising model circuit using hardware-inspired qubit layouts and gate layers.
* Visualize device qubit connectivity and selected subgraphs for your experiment.
* Demonstrate the use of [operator backpropagation (OBP)](/guides/qiskit-addons-obp) to reduce circuit depth. This technique trims operations from the circuit end at the cost of more operator measurements.
* Perform unbiased error mitigation (EM) for multiple observables simultaneously by using QESEM, comparing ideal, noisy, and mitigated results.
* Analyze and plot the impact of error mitigation on magnetization across different circuit depths.

Note: OBP will generally return a set of possibly non-commuting observables. QESEM automatically optimizes measurement bases when target observables contain non-commuting terms. It generates candidate measurement basis sets using several heuristic algorithms and selects the set that minimizes the number of distinct bases. This means QESEM groups compatible observables into common bases to reduce the total number of measurement configurations required, improving efficiency.
## About QESEM

QESEM is a reliable, high-accuracy, characterization-based software implementing efficient, unbiased quasi-probabilistic error mitigation.
It is designed to mitigate errors in generic quantum circuits and it is application-agnostic. It has been validated across diverse hardware platforms, including utility-scale experiments on IBM&reg; Eagle and Heron devices. The QESEM workflow stages are as follows:

1. Device characterization - maps gate fidelities and identifies coherent errors, providing real-time calibration data. This stage ensures that mitigation leverages the highest-fidelity operations available.
2. Noise-aware transpilation - generates and evaluates alternative qubit mappings, operation sets, and measurement bases, selecting the variant that minimizes estimated QPU runtime, with optional parallelization to accelerate data collection.
3. Error suppression - redefines native gates, applies Pauli twirling, and optimizes pulse-level control (on supported platforms) to improve fidelity.
4. Circuit characterization - builds a tailored local error model and fits it to QPU measurements to quantify residual noise.
5. Error mitigation - constructs multi-type quasi-probabilistic decompositions, and samples from them in an adaptive process that minimizes mitigation QPU time and sensitivity to hardware fluctuations, achieving high accuracies at large circuit volumes.

For more information on QESEM and a utility-scale experiment of this model on a 103-qubit, high-connectivity subgraph of the native heavy-hex geometry of `ibm_marrakesh`, refer to [Reliable high-accuracy error mitigation for utility-scale quantum circuits.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10997)
![QESEM workflow.](/docs/images/tutorials/qedma-2d-ising-with-qesem/QESEM_workflow.avif)
## Requirements

Install the following Python packages before running the notebook:

- Qiskit SDK v2.0.0 or later (`pip install qiskit`)
- Qiskit Runtime v0.40.0 or later (`pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime`)
- Qiskit Functions Catalog v0.8.0 or later ( `pip install qiskit-ibm-catalog` )
- Operator Backpropagation Qiskit addon v0.3.0 or later ( `pip install qiskit-addon-obp` )
- Qiskit Utils addon v0.1.1 or later ( `pip install qiskit-addon-utils` )
- Qiskit Aer simulator v0.17.1 or later ( `pip install qiskit-aer` )
- Matplotlib v3.10.3 or later ( `pip install matplotlib` )
## Setup
First, import the relevant libraries:

```python
# Added by doQumentation — installs packages not in the Binder environment
%pip install -q qiskit-addon-obp
```

```python
%matplotlib inline

from typing import Sequence

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

import qiskit
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import EstimatorV2 as Estimator
from qiskit_ibm_catalog import QiskitFunctionsCatalog
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit_addon_utils.slicing import combine_slices, slice_by_gate_types
from qiskit_addon_obp import backpropagate
from qiskit_addon_obp.utils.simplify import OperatorBudget
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
from qiskit.visualization import (
    plot_gate_map,
)
```

Next, authenticate using your API key from the [IBM Quantum Platform](http://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/) dashboard. Then, select the Qiskit Function as follows. (Note that for security, it is best to [save your account credentials](/guides/functions#install-qiskit-functions-catalog-client) to your local environment, if you are on a trusted machine, so that you do not have to enter your API key every time you authenticate.)

```python
# Paste here your instance and token strings

instance = "YOUR_INSTANCE"
token = "YOUR_TOKEN"
channel = "ibm_quantum_platform"

catalog = QiskitFunctionsCatalog(
    channel=channel, token=token, instance=instance
)
qesem_function = catalog.load("qedma/qesem")
```

## Step 1: Map classical inputs to a quantum problem
We start by defining a function that creates the Trotter circuit:

```python
def trotter_circuit_from_layers(
    steps: int,
    theta_x: float,
    theta_z: float,
    theta_zz: float,
    layers: Sequence[Sequence[tuple[int, int]]],
    init_state: str | None = None,
) -> qiskit.QuantumCircuit:
    """
    Generates an ising trotter circuit
    :param steps: trotter steps
    :param theta_x: RX angle
    :param theta_z: RZ angle
    :param theta_zz: RZZ angle
    :param layers: list of layers (can be list of layers in device)
    :param init_state: Initial state to prepare. If None, will not prepare any state. If "+", will
     add Hadamard gates to all qubits.
    :return: QuantumCircuit
    """
    qubits = sorted({i for layer in layers for edge in layer for i in edge})
    circ = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(max(qubits) + 1)

    if init_state == "+":
        print("init_state = +")
        for q in qubits:
            circ.h(q)

    for _ in range(steps):
        for q in qubits:
            circ.rx(theta_x, q)
            circ.rz(theta_z, q)

        for layer in layers:
            for edge in layer:
                circ.rzz(theta_zz, *edge)
        circ.barrier(qubits)

    return circ
```

Next we create a function to calculate ideal expectation values using `AerSimulator`.

Note that for large circuits (30 or more qubits) we recommend using precalculated values from belief-propagation (BP) PEPS simulations. This code includes precalculated values for 35 qubits as an example, based on the BP approach for evolving a PEPS tensor network introduced [in this paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adk4321) (which we refer to as PEPS-BP), using the tensor-network Python package [quimb.](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00819)

```python
def calculate_ideal_evs(circ, obs, num_qubits, step):
    # Predefined results for large circuits - calculated using bppeps for 3, 5, 7, 9 trotter steps
    predefined_35 = [
        0.79537,
        0.78653,
        0.79699,
    ]

    if num_qubits == 35:
        print(
            "Using precalculated ideal values for large circuits calculated with belief propagation PEPS. Currently only for 35 qubits."
        )
        return predefined_35[step]

    else:
        simulator = AerSimulator()

        # Use Estimator primitive to get expectation value
        estimator = Estimator(simulator)
        sim_result = estimator.run([(circ, [obs])], precision=0.0001).result()

        # Extracting the result
        ideal_values = sim_result[0].data.evs[0]
        return ideal_values
```

We use a hardware-based $R_{ZZ}$ layer mapping taken from the Heron device, from which we cut out the layers according to the number of qubits we want to simulate. We define subgraphs for 10, 21, 28, and 35 qubits that maintain a 2D structure (feel free to change to your favorite subgraph):

plot_gate_map(
    backend=backend,
    figsize=(15, 10),
    qubit_color=qubit_color,
)
plt.show()
```

Notice that the connectivity of the chosen qubit layout is not necessarily linear, and can cover large regions of the Heron device depending on the selected number of qubits.

Now we generate the Trotter circuit and the average magnetization observable for the chosen number of qubits and parameters:

```python
# Chosen parameters:
theta_x = 0.53
theta_z = 0.1
theta_zz = 1.0
steps = 9

circ = trotter_circuit_from_layers(steps, theta_x, theta_z, theta_zz, layers)
print(
    f"Circuit 2q layers: {circ.depth(filter_function=lambda instr: len(instr.qubits) == 2)}"
)
print("\nCircuit structure:")

circ.draw("mpl", scale=0.8, fold=-1, idle_wires=False)
plt.show()

observable = qiskit.quantum_info.SparsePauliOp.from_sparse_list(
    [("Z", [q], 1 / n_qubits) for q in subgraphs[n_qubits]],
    np.max(subgraphs[n_qubits]) + 1,

## Step 2: Optimize problem for quantum hardware execution
### QPU time estimation with and without OBP
Users generally want to know how much QPU time is required for their experiment.
However, this is considered a hard problem for classical computers.

QESEM offers two modes of time estimation to inform users about the feasibility of their experiments:
1. Analytical time estimation - gives a very rough estimation and requires no QPU time. This can be used to test if a transpilation pass would potentially reduce the QPU time.
2. Empirical time estimation (demonstrated here) - gives a pretty good estimation and uses a few minutes of QPU time.

In both cases, QESEM outputs the time estimation for reaching the required precision for **all** observables.

```python
run_on_real_hardware = True

precision = 0.05
if run_on_real_hardware:
    backend_name = "ibm_fez"
else:
    backend_name = "fake_fez"

# Start a job for empirical time estimation
estimation_job_wo_obp = qesem_function.run(
    pubs=[(circ, obs_list)],
    instance=instance,
    backend_name=backend_name,  # E.g. "ibm_brisbane"
    options={
        "estimate_time_only": "empirical",  # "empirical" - gets actual time estimates without running full mitigation
        "max_execution_time": 120,  # Limits the QPU time, specified in seconds.
        "default_precision": precision,
    },
)
```

```python
print(estimation_job_wo_obp.job_id)
print(estimation_job_wo_obp.status())
```

```text
17d3828e-9fdb-482e-8e9b-392f3eefe313
DONE
```

```python
# Get the result object (blocking method). Use job.status() in a loop for non-blocking.
# This takes 1-3 minutes
result = estimation_job_wo_obp.result()
```

```python
print(
    f"Empirical time estimation (sec): {result[0].metadata['time_estimation_sec']}"
)
```

```text
Empirical time estimation (sec): 1200
```

Now we will use operator backpropagation (OBP). (See the [OBP](/guides/qiskit-addons-obp) guide for more details on the OBP Qiskit addon.) We will create a function that generates the circuit slices for backpropagation:

```python
def run_backpropagation(circ_vec, observable, steps_vec, max_qwc_groups=8):
    """
    Runs backpropagation for a list of circuits and observables.
    Returns lists of backpropagated circuits and observables.
    """
    op_budget = OperatorBudget(max_qwc_groups=max_qwc_groups)
    bp_circuit_vec = []
    bp_observable_vec = []

    for i, circ in enumerate(circ_vec):
        slices = slice_by_gate_types(circ)
        bp_observable, remaining_slices, metadata = backpropagate(
            observable,
            slices,
            operator_budget=op_budget,
        )
        bp_circuit = combine_slices(remaining_slices, include_barriers=True)
        bp_circuit_vec.append(bp_circuit)
        bp_observable_vec.append(bp_observable)
        print(f"n.o. steps: {steps_vec[i]}")
        print(f"Backpropagated {metadata.num_backpropagated_slices} slices.")
        print(
            f"New observable has {len(bp_observable.paulis)} terms, which can be combined into "
            f"{len(bp_observable.group_commuting(qubit_wise=True))} groups.\n"
            f"After truncation, the error in our observable is bounded by {metadata.accumulated_error(0):.3e}"
        )
        print("-----------------")
    return bp_circuit_vec, bp_observable_vec
```

We call the function:

```python
bp_circ_vec, bp_obs_vec = run_backpropagation([circ], observable, [steps])
```

```text
n.o. steps: 9
Backpropagated 11 slices.
New observable has 363 terms, which can be combined into 4 groups.
After truncation, the error in our observable is bounded by 0.000e+00
-----------------
```

```python
print("The remaining circuit after backpropagation looks as follows:")
bp_circ_vec[-1].draw("mpl", scale=0.8, fold=-1, idle_wires=False)
None
```

```text
The remaining circuit after backpropagation looks as follows:
```

![Output of the previous code cell](/docs/images/tutorials/qedma-2d-ising-with-qesem/extracted-outputs/cedb7fa1-1.avif)

We can see that the backpropagation reduced two layers of the circuit.
Now that we have our reduced circuit and expanded observables, let's do time estimation to the backpropagated circuit:

```python
# Start a job for empirical time estimation
estimation_job_obp = qesem_function.run(
    pubs=[(bp_circ_vec[-1], [bp_obs_vec[-1]])],
    instance=instance,
    backend_name=backend_name,
    options={
        "estimate_time_only": "empirical",
        "max_execution_time": 120,
        "default_precision": precision,
    },
)
```

```python
print(estimation_job_obp.job_id)
print(estimation_job_obp.status())
```

```text
8bae699d-a16b-4d39-bbd9-d123fbcce55d
DONE
```

```python
result_obp = estimation_job_obp.result()
```

```python
print(
    f"Empirical time estimation (sec): {result_obp[0].metadata['time_estimation_sec']}"
)
```

```text
Empirical time estimation (sec): 900
```

We see that OBP reduces the time cost for mitigation of the circuit.
## Step 3: Execute using Qiskit primitives
### Run with real backend
Now we run the full experiment on a couple of Trotter steps. The number of qubits, required precision, and maximal QPU time can be modified according to the available QPU resources. Note that restricting the maximal QPU time will affect the final precision, as you will see in the final plot below.

We analyze four circuits with 5, 7, and 9 Trotter steps at a precision of 0.05, comparing their ideal, noisy, and error-mitigated expectation values:

```python
steps_vec = [5, 7, 9]

circ_vec = []
for steps in steps_vec:
    circ = trotter_circuit_from_layers(
        steps, theta_x, theta_z, theta_zz, layers
    )
    circ_vec.append(circ)
```

Again, we perform OBP on each circuit to reduce runtime:

```python
bp_circ_vec_35, bp_obs_vec_35 = run_backpropagation(
    circ_vec, observable, steps_vec
)
```

```text
n.o. steps: 5
Backpropagated 11 slices.
New observable has 363 terms, which can be combined into 4 groups.
After truncation, the error in our observable is bounded by 0.000e+00
-----------------
n.o. steps: 7
Backpropagated 11 slices.
New observable has 363 terms, which can be combined into 4 groups.
After truncation, the error in our observable is bounded by 0.000e+00
-----------------
n.o. steps: 9
Backpropagated 11 slices.
New observable has 363 terms, which can be combined into 4 groups.
After truncation, the error in our observable is bounded by 0.000e+00
-----------------
```

Now we run a batch of full QESEM jobs. We limit the maximal QPU runtime for each of the points for better control on the QPU budget.

```python
run_on_real_hardware = True

precision = 0.05
if run_on_real_hardware:
    backend_name = "ibm_marrakesh"
else:
    backend_name = "fake_fez"
```

```python
# Running full jobs for:
pubs_list = [
    [(bp_circ_vec_35[i], bp_obs_vec_35[i])] for i in range(len(bp_obs_vec_35))
]
```

```python
# Initiating multiple jobs for different lengths
job_list = []
for pubs in pubs_list:
    job_obp = qesem_function.run(
        pubs=pubs,
        instance=instance,
        backend_name=backend_name,  # E.g. "ibm_brisbane"
        options={
            "max_execution_time": 300,  # Limits the QPU time, specified in seconds.
            "default_precision": 0.05,
        },
    )
    job_list.append(job_obp)
```

Here we check the status of each job:

```python
for job in job_list:
    print(job.status())
```

```text
DONE
DONE
DONE
DONE
```

## Step 4: Post-process and return result in desired classical format
When all jobs are finished running, we can compare their noisy and mitigated expectation value.

```python
ideal_values = []
noisy_values = []
error_mitigated_values = []
error_mitigated_stds = []

for i in range(len(job_list)):
    job = job_list[i]
    result = job.result()  # Blocking - takes 3-5 minutes
    noisy_results = result[0].metadata["noisy_results"]

    ideal_val = calculate_ideal_evs(circ_vec[i], observable, n_qubits, i)
    print("---------------------------------")
    print(f"Ideal: {ideal_val}")
    print(f"Noisy: {noisy_results.evs}")
    print(f"QESEM: {result[0].data.evs} \u00b1 {result[0].data.stds}")

    ideal_values.append(ideal_val)
    noisy_values.append(noisy_results.evs)
    error_mitigated_values.append(result[0].data.evs)
    error_mitigated_stds.append(result[0].data.stds)
```

Lastly, we can plot the magnetization versus the number of steps. This summarizes the benefit of using the QESEM Qiskit Function for bias-free error mitigation on noisy quantum devices.

```python
plt.plot(steps_vec, ideal_values, "--", label="ideal")
plt.scatter(steps_vec, noisy_values, label="noisy")
plt.errorbar(
    steps_vec,
    error_mitigated_values,
    yerr=error_mitigated_stds,
    fmt="o",
    capsize=5,
    label="QESEM mitigation",
)
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel("n.o. steps")
plt.ylabel("Magnetization")
```

```text

<Admonition type="note">

The ninth step has a large statistical error bar because we limited the QPU time to 5 minutes. If you run this step for 15 minutes (as the empirical time estimation suggests), you will get a smaller error bar. Hence, the mitigated value will become closer to the ideal value.
