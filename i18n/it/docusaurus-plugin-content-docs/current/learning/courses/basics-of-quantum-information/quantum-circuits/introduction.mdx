<IBMVideo id="134056224" title="In this video, John Watrous describes introduces quantum circuits. He demonstrates how circuits represent quantum operations and builds the connection with matrix operations."/>

This lesson introduces the *quantum circuit* model of computation, which provides a standard way to describe quantum computations.

The lesson also introduces a few important mathematical concepts, including *inner products* between vectors, the notions of *orthogonality* and *orthonormality*, and *projections* and *projective measurements*, which generalize standard basis measurements.
Through these concepts, we'll derive fundamental limitations on quantum information, including the *no-cloning theorem* and the impossibility to perfectly discriminate non-orthogonal quantum states.
