<Admonition type="note" title="Notes">
* Qiskit Functions are an experimental feature available only to IBM Quantum&reg; Premium Plan, Flex Plan, and On-Prem (via IBM Quantum Platform API) Plan users. They are in preview release status and subject to change.
</Admonition>
<details>
<summary><b>Package versions</b></summary>

The code on this page was developed using the following requirements.
We recommend using these versions or newer.

```
qiskit[all]~=1.4.1
qiskit-ibm-runtime~=0.37.0
qiskit-ibm-catalog~=0.4
```
</details>
Qiskit Functions simplify and accelerate utility-scale algorithm discovery and application development, by abstracting away parts of the quantum software development workflow. In this way, Qiskit Functions free up time normally spent hand-writing code and fine-tuning experiments.

![Overview of Qiskit Functions](/docs/images/guides/functions/functions-overview.svg)
Functions come in two forms:

| Type | What does it do? | Example inputs and outputs | Who is it for? |
| - | - | - | - |
| Circuit function | Simplified interface for running circuits. Abstracts transpilation, error suppression, and error mitigation | **Input**: Abstract `PUB` objects <br/> **Output**: Mitigated expectation values | Researchers using Qiskit to discover new algorithms and applications, without needing to focus on optimizing for hardware or handling error. Circuit functions can be used to build custom application functions. |
| Application function | Covers higher-level tasks, such as exploring algorithms and domain-specific use cases. Abstracts quantum workflow to solve tasks, with classical inputs and outputs | **Input**: Molecules, graphs <br/> **Output**: Ground + excited state energy, optimal values for cost function | Researchers in non-quantum domains, integrating quantum into existing large-scale classical workflows, without needing to map classical data to quantum circuits. |
Functions are provided by IBM&reg; and third-party partners. Each is performant for specific workload characteristics and has unique performance-tuning options.

## Get started with Qiskit Functions
Premium, Flex, and On-Prem (through the IBM Quantum Platform API) Plan users can get started with IBM Qiskit Functions for free, or can procure a license from one of the partners who have contributed a function to the catalog.

### Request a free trial for third-party Qiskit Functions

To request a new free trial, navigate to the [Qiskit Functions Catalog](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/functions), and explore the details panel. Click on `Request a free trial` and fill out information required by the Functions partner, including the IBM Cloud `AccessGroupId`:

1. Navigate to [IBM Cloud IAM.](http://cloud.ibm.com/iam/groups)
2. Verify eligibility.
   - Switch your account in the top bar to one with the following format: `XXXXXXX - [Organization Name]`
   - Ensure the organization is the same as the one associated with your Premium account.
   - If you see "[Your Name]'s Account", you are using your _personal_ account, which is not eligible for premium access.
3. Find your access group ID.
   - Click a group name.
   - Click **Details**.
   - Copy the access group ID. It should start with `AccessGroup-`.

### Install Qiskit Functions Catalog client

1. To start using Qiskit Functions, install the IBM Qiskit Functions Catalog client:

    ```bash
    pip install qiskit-ibm-catalog
    ```
1. Retrieve your API key from the [IBM Quantum Platform dashboard](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/), and activate your Python virtual environment.  See the [installation instructions](/guides/install-qiskit#local) if you do not already have a virtual environment set up.

    <span id="save-account"></span>**If you are working in a trusted Python environment (such as on a personal laptop or workstation),** use the `save_account()` method to save your credentials locally. ([Skip to the next step](#functions-untrusted) if you are not using a trusted environment, such as a shared or public computer, to authenticate to IBM Quantum Platform.)

    To use `save_account()`, run `python` in your shell, then enter the following:

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_catalog import QiskitFunctionsCatalog

    QiskitFunctionsCatalog.save_account(channel="ibm_quantum_platform", token="<your-token>", instance="<instance-crn>")
    ```

    Type `exit()`. From now on, whenever you need to authenticate to the service, you can load your credentials with
    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_catalog import QiskitFunctionsCatalog
    catalog = QiskitFunctionsCatalog()
    ```

```python
# Load saved credentials
from qiskit_ibm_catalog import QiskitFunctionsCatalog

catalog = QiskitFunctionsCatalog(channel="ibm_quantum_platform")
```

3. <span id="functions-untrusted"></span>**Avoid executing code on an untrusted machine or an external cloud Python environment to minimize security risks.** If you must use an untrusted environment (on, for example, a public computer), change your API key after each use by deleting it on the [IBM Cloud API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) page to reduce risk. Learn more in the [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui) topic. To initialize the service in this situation, expand the following section to view code you can use:

    <details>
        <summary>Initialize the service in an untrusted environment</summary>

    ```python
    from qiskit_ibm_catalog import QiskitFunctionsCatalog

    # After using the following code, delete your API key on the IBM Quantum Platform home dashboard
    catalog = QiskitFunctionsCatalog(token="<YOUR_API_KEY>") # Use the 44-character API_KEY you created and saved from the IBM Quantum Platform Home dashboard
    ```
    </details>
    <Admonition type="caution">
      **Protect your API key!** Never include your key in source code, Python script, or notebook file. When sharing code with others, ensure that your API key is not embedded directly within the Python script. Instead, share the script without the key and provide instructions for securely setting it up.

      If you accidentally share your key with someone or include it in version control like Git, immediately revoke your key by deleting it on the [IBM Cloud API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) page to reduce risk. Learn more in the [Managing user API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey&interface=ui) topic.
    </Admonition>
4. After you have authenticated, you can list the functions from the Qiskit Functions Catalog that you have access to:

```python
catalog.list()
```

```text
[QiskitFunction(qunova/hivqe-chemistry),
 QiskitFunction(global-data-quantum/quantum-portfolio-optimizer),
 QiskitFunction(algorithmiq/tem),
 QiskitFunction(qedma/qesem),
 QiskitFunction(multiverse/singularity),
 QiskitFunction(ibm/circuit-function),
 QiskitFunction(q-ctrl/optimization-solver),
 QiskitFunction(colibritd/quick-pde),
 QiskitFunction(q-ctrl/performance-management),
 QiskitFunction(kipu-quantum/iskay-quantum-optimizer)]
```

### Run enabled functions

After a catalog object has been instantiated, you can select a function using `catalog.load(provider/function-name)`:

```python
ibm_cf = catalog.load("ibm/circuit-function")
```

Each Qiskit Function has custom inputs, options, and outputs. Check the specific documentation pages for the function you want to run for more information. By default, all users can only run one function job at a time:

```python
# This cell is hidden from users
# It gets these details programmatically so we can test this notebook
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import QiskitRuntimeService
from qiskit.circuit.random import random_circuit

service = QiskitRuntimeService()
instance = service.active_account()["instance"]
backend_name = service.least_busy().name

circuit = random_circuit(num_qubits=2, depth=2, seed=42)
observable = "Z" * circuit.num_qubits
```

```python
job = ibm_cf.run(
    pubs=[(circuit, observable)],
    instance=instance,
    backend_name=backend_name,  # E.g. "ibm_fez"
)

job.job_id
```

```text
'7f08c9d5-471b-4da2-92e7-4f2cb94c23a8'
```

### Check job status

<Admonition type="tip">
Currently, the IBM Quantum workloads table only reflects Qiskit Runtime workloads. Use `job.status()` to see your Qiskit Function workload's current status.
</Admonition>

With your Qiskit Function `job_id`, you can check the status of running jobs. This includes the following statuses:

- **`QUEUED`**: The remote program is in the Qiskit Function queue. The queue priority is based on how much you've used Qiskit Functions.
- **`INITIALIZING`**: The remote program is starting; this includes setting up the remote environment and installing dependencies.
- **`RUNNING`**: The program is running. This also includes several more detailed statuses if supported by specific functions
    - **`RUNNING: MAPPING`**": The function is currently mapping your classical inputs to quantum inputs
    - **`RUNNING: OPTIMIZING_FOR_HARDWARE`**": The function is optimizing for the selected QPU. This could include circuit transpilation, QPU characterization, observable backpropagation, and so forth
    - **`RUNNING: WAITING_FOR_QPU`**: The function has submitted a job to Qiskit Runtime, and is waiting in the queue
    - **`RUNNING: EXECUTING_QPU`**: The function has an active Qiskit Runtime job
    - **`RUNNING: POST_PROCESSING`**: The function is post-processing results. This could include error mitigation, mapping quantum results to classical, and so forth
- **`DONE`**: The program is complete, and you can retrieve result data with `job.results()`.
- **`ERROR`**: The program stopped running because of a problem. Use `job.result()` to get the error message.
- **`CANCELED`**: The program was canceled; either by a user, the service, or the server.

```python
job.status()
```

```text
'QUEUED'
```

### Retrieve results

After a program is `DONE`, you can use `job.results()` to fetch the result. This output format varies with each function, so be sure to follow the specific documentation:

```python
result = job.result()
print(result)
```

```text
PrimitiveResult([PubResult(data=DataBin(evs=np.ndarray(<shape=(), dtype=float64>), stds=np.ndarray(<shape=(), dtype=float64>), ensemble_standard_error=np.ndarray(<shape=(), dtype=float64>)), metadata={'shots': 4096, 'target_precision': 0.015625, 'circuit_metadata': {}, 'resilience': {}, 'num_randomizations': 32})], metadata={'dynamical_decoupling': {'enable': True, 'sequence_type': 'XX', 'extra_slack_distribution': 'middle', 'scheduling_method': 'alap'}, 'twirling': {'enable_gates': False, 'enable_measure': True, 'num_randomizations': 'auto', 'shots_per_randomization': 'auto', 'interleave_randomizations': True, 'strategy': 'active-accum'}, 'resilience': {'measure_mitigation': True, 'zne_mitigation': False, 'pec_mitigation': False}, 'version': 2})
```

You can also cancel a job at any time:

```python
job.stop()
```

```text
'Job has been stopped.'
```

### List previously run jobs run with Qiskit Functions

You can use `jobs()` to list all jobs submitted to Qiskit Functions:

```python
old_jobs = catalog.jobs()
old_jobs
```

```text
[<Job | f6c29f49-4d5f-4fff-aca6-2e9a115b9763>,
 <Job | 7f08c9d5-471b-4da2-92e7-4f2cb94c23a8>,
 <Job | 62fe9176-d1e5-467e-b2bd-7a3f3c7be4e5>,
 <Job | af525b2e-16b1-45a1-80bb-dbd94ce30258>,
 <Job | b95a7a57-c1ad-4958-b7ac-953e4e1ee824>,
 <Job | 7bfa33da-0f17-4e67-84b6-f556f7eeb436>,
 <Job | ca46c191-9eb9-4de6-bfa7-b60d7eb29b5e>,
 <Job | 6ac0ba93-3831-43fb-9fb9-760da2225e06>,
 <Job | f0e38071-060d-47e8-988d-9cc1f69358e3>,
 <Job | 629cf110-e490-4675-8a07-f6d298d166b0>]
```

If you already have the job ID for a certain job, you can retrieve the job with `catalog.get_job_by_id()`:

```python
# First, get the most recent job that has been executed.
latest_job = old_jobs[0]

# We can also get that same job with get_job_by_id
job_by_id = catalog.get_job_by_id(latest_job.job_id)

# Verify that the job is the same using both retrieval methods.
assert job_by_id.job_id == latest_job.job_id

# Print the job_id for this job.
print(job_by_id.job_id)
```

```text
f6c29f49-4d5f-4fff-aca6-2e9a115b9763
```

### Fetch error messages

If a program status is `ERROR`, use `job.error_message()` to fetch the error message as follows:

```python
job.error_message()
```

```text
qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError: 'Workflow execution failed -- https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/errors#9999'
```
